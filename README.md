# Fully Connected Neural Network Project

Author: Aaron Pueschel  
Project Duration: 12/20/2023 - 01/09/2024

## Overview

Welcome to my Fully Connected Neural Network project! This project marks the beginning of my journey into Machine Learning using Artificial Neural Networks. I hope to use this project as a tool for learning all the nuances of the mathematics behind my favorite ML libraries (PyTorch is mine, and this project is based on it). I also hope to add some functionality that will dive into other subjects that are often used in conjuction with large scale data analysis (More on this later)

## Motivation

Originally initiated as an assignment for an optimization class in the fall of 2023, this project was intended for implementation in MATLAB. However, it found its home in PyTorch, allowing me to delve into the performance of optimization algorithms when learning noisy mappings for benchmark optimization functions on fully connected neural networks. The project started as a regression problem and later extended to handle classification tasks.

## Features

- Fully connected neural network implementation
- Support for both Adam and SGD optimization algorithms
- Various activation functions to choose from
- Capabilities for both classification and regression tasks
- Gradient clipping for enhanced training stability
- Tensor multiplication and sequential operations
- Validation metrics to evaluate model performance
- State-saving functionality for easy model persistence and retrieval

## Future Development

While this project is primarily a personal endeavor, it marks the beginning of an exciting journey. I plan to continue its development, exploring features like CUDA HPC support, code generation, and more.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or simply want to discuss the project!

## Get Started 
#### Dependecies
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- pickle
- scikit-learn / sklearn

My current implementationackles the multi-class classification problem using the Minst dataset. While not intended as a tutorial, please see the file labled `FullyConnectedMinst.ipynb`.
